# SSENSE Hiring Test

Welcome at the SSENSE Hiring Test ! 

You will first have to create an account on https://c9.io/ so we can share the workspace where the test will take on. Once it's done, please send us your username or the email address used to create the account.

This test will be about programming skills of course, but also about it will demonstrate your capacities of working with a given PHP framework, use MySQL, git, etc. but more importantly: how are you going to do it in a near real-life context.

Here's how the test will go:
 - You'll be given a list of tasks by the manager that needs to be done and a git branch where to checkout from.
 - Each task must be on a different branch named with "task_" + your c9.io username and the number of the task (ex: task_johndoe_E1)
 - You must push your branches
 - Write to your test manager when everything is done
 
At any time the test manager can enter the workspace and have a look about what your doing. You can also always ask him questions when something isn't clear.
